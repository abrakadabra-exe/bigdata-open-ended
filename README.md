# bigdata-open-ended
BigData LAB open ended lab assignment.


You are provided with two datasets.
1. The Penguin Datasets: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv.
The dataset has 6 features (Flipper length, Bill length and weight, mass, sex and which island it was found)
and one target (species). Create a predictive model using any supervised ML techniques that can predict
the species using the features.
2. Graduate Admission Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions. The
dataset has 6 features (GRE and TOEFL Scores, Rating of the applied university, Strength of SOP and
LOR, CGPA and Research Experience) and one target (chance of admission). Create a supervised
predictive model to predict the chance of admission of a student.


Open-ended features:
● Use any of the suitable data structures to store the data.
● Use your preferred programming language (Python, C, C++ etc.)
● The output can be a text-based interface or a graphical interface


Tasks
1. Describe the characteristics of the datasets and try to find any underlying pattern to build
a hypothesis by using data exploratory tasks.
2. Implement the necessary pre-processing techniques to handle missing values or encode
the data into usable formats.
3. Select the appropriate supervised machine-learning techniques to handle the data.
4. Implement the ML techniques.
5. Use K-fold cross validation with appropriate performance evaluation metric.
6. Compile a report on the stated problem including the justifications, codes, simulations,
inputs/outputs.
